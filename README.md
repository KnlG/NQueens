# NQueens
The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

Here I use Iterative Min Conflicts algorithm to solve the problem. 
    
To write this program I used the solution in the following source(in python): https://gist.github.com/vedantk/747203

To test (you should have java installed):
 - Download bin/Main.class
 - Open command line
 - Go to the directory the file exists
 - Type java Main
